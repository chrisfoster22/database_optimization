1. 4615.53892 seconds (~ an hour and 17 minutes) to seed.
2. First test in browser: Infinity. Could not wait for this to complete.
3. 10.5348s to add indices.
4. After adding the indices, the page loaded after 6.30 seconds. By my calculations this is an infinite improvement over before.
5. After altering the code, the page took 2.59s to load. That is ~58% improvement in runtime.
6. It seems to be taking a longer time. Adding indices after migrating seems quicker than adding them with the initial database setup.
7. DB: 27942912 bytes
8. logs: 772941650 bytes
9. truncate? vacuum?
10. I think this database may be smaller than what I will encounter in my career.
